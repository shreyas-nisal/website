                <p class="lead">Although I did a course on C programming in 2013, it was only about an year after that I put my programming skills to build something. I did not, however, use C, but instead made a simple game using Visual BASIC. It was then that my journey in game development began, and I have been in love with game development ever since. Continue reading to know more about all the games I developed with Visual BASIC....</p>

                    <p class="game-info">As part of a contest, I had to develop a game that involved learning Sanskrit. The end result of this contest was a game similar to snake, where the user controlled a green block and was expected to collect items numbered in Sanskrit in ascending order. The game had multiple levels, with the count going right upto one hundred. One of the most interesting feature of this game was that there was not a single word in English. This included the menu and the alerts that came up during the game. Although the results of the contest were not in my favour, the game had got me into developing games with Visual BASIC, something that continued for the year and a half that followed.</p>

                    <p class="game-info">Once I had been introduced to developing games, I started off on making a really popular arcade game- the kind where you battle space enemies. The player moved around by moving the cursor, and could fire bullets at enemies by clicking. I called this game <b>Air Battle</b>, and worked on it seriously, making boss-levels and rewarding the player with special abilities such as a time-bound shield and so on. This was a game that taught me a lot, and it was a great experience building this game and the next, so that I could prepare myself to make some better games.</p>

                    <p class="game-info">Another really popular game that all people developing games make in their early days is the brick-breaker. This was the next game that I made, and I made a few levels of this, making sure to give atteention to detail so as to make the game fool-proof before moving on to other games.</p>

                    <p class="game-info">This game, called <b>Track-Ball</b>, remained my favourite for a long time. I put in a lot of effort in making the game fool-proof and also adding a lot of stuff to this game. The player was supposed to control a ball and make it reach a 'Goal', without letting it fall of the track. The game had four levels of increasing difficulty, with the third level involving surprise obstacles and the fourth one involving a surprise change of track. Every time the user failed to complete a level, the game got reset to level-1, and this covered up for the fewer levels in the game. I also added level-codes to the game for me to be able to start from any level I wanted.</p>

                    <p class="game-info">This game was very similar to a brick-breaker, except that it had no bricks! The player's goal was to control <em>two</em> paddles instead of one, and keep the ball from hitting the top or the bottom of the screen. What added to the difficulty of the game was the fact that the paddles moved in <em>opposite</em> directions! Since the player's aim was just to hold on for as long as possible, I named this game <b>Survive</b>. More than an year later, I also made this game for Android, and since I was unable to find a similar game on the play store, I launched that game, called 'Survival', on the Google Play Store.</p>

                    <p class="game-info">This game, called <b>Bubbble-Pop</b>, was the last game I made using Visual BASIC. I added loads of features to this one too. The player's aim was to click on bubbles to pop them, making sure none escaped through the top of the screen. The game had ability bubbles that the user could pop to gain an ability that he/she could trigger by right-clicking, which popped all bubbles on the screen. It also had poison bubbles that the player was supposed to avoid popping, and more. This was the most enjoyable game I made before switching my attention to the Unity engine and Android games.</p>
